Creating my first javaScript guessing game took about 2 hours. I built it by using a bunch of nested if else loops. But then I worked with Mark and he reminded me that I could use a while loop to limit the number of tries users get at the questions instead of prompting them with new questions. So I started over and used a while loop to limit the number of guesses to 3, which took another 2 hours, but in the end it worked better and the code was a lot shorter.

The whole project took me about 4 hours. I already know about while loops from the codeacademy tutorials, but I needed a reminder. I did learn something completely new to me from Tyler about using .indexOf !== -1 to determine if the guesses appeared in my array.
